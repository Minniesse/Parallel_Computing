# High-Performance Parallel Matrix Multiplication
## Project Proposal and Showcase Plan

### 1. Project Overview

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in numerous domains including deep learning, scientific computing, computer graphics, and simulation. The standard algorithm for multiplying two matrices has cubic time complexity O(n³), making it computationally intensive for large inputs. This project aims to implement and analyze a high-performance matrix multiplication algorithm that systematically exploits multiple levels of parallelism available in modern hardware architectures.

Modern computer systems provide several levels of parallelism that can be utilized to improve performance and reduce power consumption:
- Vector processing units for instruction-level parallelism (SIMD)
- Multiple cores for thread-level parallelism
- Specialized accelerators like GPUs for heterogeneous parallelism

By combining these approaches, we can achieve compounding performance benefits while gaining insights into the trade-offs between implementation complexity and performance gains.

### 2. Proposed Optimizations

#### 2.1 Instruction-Level Parallelism (SIMD)

We will implement SIMD optimizations using AVX-512 vector instructions to process multiple elements simultaneously:

- Utilize AVX-512 to process 16 floating-point operations in parallel
- Implement memory alignment to 64-byte boundaries for optimal vector operations
- Apply loop unrolling to reduce branch prediction overhead
- Use register blocking to maximize data reuse within vector registers

Example implementation for the inner block multiplication kernel:

```c
// Process 16 elements at once using AVX-512
void multiply_block_avx512(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, 
                          int block_size, int lda, int ldb, int ldc) {
  for (int i = 0; i < block_size; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < block_size; j += 16) {
      __m512 c_vec = _mm512_setzero_ps();
      
      for (int k = 0; k < block_size; k++) {
        __m512 a_vec = _mm512_set1_ps(A[i*lda + k]);
        __m512 b_vec = _mm512_loadu_ps(&B[k*ldb + j]);
        c_vec = _mm512_fmadd_ps(a_vec, b_vec, c_vec);
      }
      
      _mm512_storeu_ps(&C[i*ldc + j], c_vec);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Shared-Memory Parallelism (Multithreading)

We will leverage OpenMP to parallelize the outermost loop of our blocked algorithm:

- Implement OpenMP parallelization with dynamic scheduling
- Optimize thread affinity for NUMA architectures
- Explore recursive decomposition for better load balancing
- Apply thread-level blocking to optimize for shared cache usage

```c
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)
for (int i = 0; i < m; i += BLOCK_SIZE) {
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j += BLOCK_SIZE) {
    for (int p = 0; p < k; p += BLOCK_SIZE) {
      multiply_block_avx512(&A[i*lda + p], &B[p*ldb + j], 
                          &C[i*ldc + j], BLOCK_SIZE, lda, ldb, ldc);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2.3 Heterogeneous Parallelism (GPU)

For GPU acceleration, we will implement:

- CUDA matrix multiplication with shared memory tiling
- Coalesced memory access patterns for optimal memory bandwidth
- Tensor core acceleration for mixed-precision calculations (on supported hardware)
- Adaptive runtime selection between CPU and GPU based on problem size

We will analyze the trade-offs between computation time and data transfer overhead to determine when GPU acceleration is beneficial.

### 6. Conclusion

This project aims to systematically explore and apply parallel programming techniques to optimize matrix multiplication across multiple hardware levels. By combining SIMD instructions, multithreading, and GPU acceleration, we expect to achieve near-optimal performance while gaining insights into effective parallelization strategies for compute-intensive workloads. The implementation will demonstrate how understanding hardware characteristics and carefully structuring algorithms can lead to significant performance improvements and reduced power consumption.
