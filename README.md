# Parallel Image Processing Pipeline
## Project Proposal and Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Overview

Image processing is a computationally intensive domain with applications spanning computer vision, medical imaging, digital photography, and video production. Operations such as blurring, edge detection, and color transformations require applying mathematical operations to millions of pixels, making them perfect candidates for parallelization.

This project aims to develop a high-performance image processing pipeline in Python that leverages multiple levels of parallelism to achieve significant speedups over sequential implementations. By exploiting modern hardware capabilities, we can process high-resolution images and videos in near real-time while reducing power consumption.

The key innovation of this project lies in systematically applying different parallelization strategies at multiple levels and evaluating their combined impact on performance. This approach will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of various optimization techniques for image processing tasks and serve as a practical demonstration of parallel programming principles.

### 2. Proposed Optimizations

#### 2.1 Instruction-Level Parallelism (SIMD)

Modern CPUs offer Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) capabilities that allow performing the same operation on multiple data elements simultaneously. We will leverage these capabilities through:

- **Vectorized NumPy Operations**: Utilize NumPy's vectorized operations which automatically leverage CPU SIMD instructions through optimized backends like Intel MKL or OpenBLAS.
- **Numba JIT Compilation**: Apply Numba's just-in-time compilation to critical processing functions, enabling automatic SIMD vectorization of Python code.
- **Memory Layout Optimization**: Restructure data access patterns to maximize cache locality and enable more efficient SIMD operations.
- **Custom Vector Extensions**: Implement specialized image processing kernels using explicit SIMD intrinsics via libraries like PyVectorized.

Example implementation for a Numba-accelerated Gaussian blur kernel:

```python
import numba
import numpy as np

@numba.jit(nopython=True, parallel=True)
def gaussian_blur(image, kernel):
    height, width = image.shape[0], image.shape[1]
    kernel_height, kernel_width = kernel.shape
    padding_h = kernel_height // 2
    padding_w = kernel_width // 2
    
    output = np.zeros_like(image)
    
    for i in numba.prange(padding_h, height - padding_h):
        for j in range(padding_w, width - padding_w):
            val = 0
            for ki in range(kernel_height):
                for kj in range(kernel_width):
                    val += image[i + ki - padding_h, j + kj - padding_w] * kernel[ki, kj]
            output[i, j] = val
            
    return output
```

#### 2.2 Shared-Memory Parallelism (Multithreading)

We will leverage multi-core processing to parallelize image operations across CPU cores:

- **Image Tiling**: Divide images into tiles that can be processed independently in parallel.
- **Process Pool Execution**: Use Python's multiprocessing library to create a pool of worker processes for parallel tile processing.
- **Pipeline Parallelism**: Implement a pipeline architecture where different processing stages execute concurrently on different cores.
- **Work Stealing Scheduler**: Develop a dynamic work-stealing scheduler to balance load across cores for irregular workloads.

Example implementation for parallel image processing using multiprocessing:

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
import numpy as np

def process_tile(args):
    tile, operation, params = args
    # Apply operation to tile
    return operation(tile, **params)

def parallel_process(image, operation, params, tile_size=(256, 256)):
    height, width = image.shape[:2]
    
    # Create tiles
    tiles = []
    tile_positions = []
    
    for y in range(0, height, tile_size[0]):
        for x in range(0, width, tile_size[1]):
            h = min(tile_size[0], height - y)
            w = min(tile_size[1], width - x)
            tile = image[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            tiles.append(tile)
            tile_positions.append((y, x, h, w))
    
    # Process tiles in parallel
    with Pool() as pool:
        processed_tiles = pool.map(process_tile, [(tile, operation, params) for tile in tiles])
    
    # Reconstruct the image
    result = np.zeros_like(image)
    for (y, x, h, w), processed_tile in zip(tile_positions, processed_tiles):
        result[y:y+h, x:x+w] = processed_tile
        
    return result
```

#### 2.3 Heterogeneous Parallelism (GPU)

Modern GPUs offer massive parallelism for data-parallel tasks like image processing. We will leverage GPU acceleration through:

- **CuPy/PyTorch-Based Implementation**: Utilize CuPy or PyTorch for GPU-accelerated array operations.
- **Custom CUDA Kernels**: Develop specialized CUDA kernels for operations not efficiently handled by existing libraries.
- **Optimized Memory Transfers**: Implement strategies to minimize CPU-GPU data transfer overhead.
- **Hybrid Processing**: Dynamically select between CPU and GPU based on input size and operation complexity.

Example implementation of a GPU-accelerated image filter using CuPy:

```python
import cupy as cp

def gpu_convolution(image, kernel):
    # Transfer data to GPU
    gpu_image = cp.asarray(image)
    gpu_kernel = cp.asarray(kernel)
    
    # Perform convolution on GPU
    result = cp.correlate(gpu_image, gpu_kernel, mode='same')
    
    # Transfer result back to CPU
    return cp.asnumpy(result)
```

### 3. Evaluation Methodology
