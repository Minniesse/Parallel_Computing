# High-Performance Parallel Matrix Multiplication
## Project Proposal

### 1. Project Overview

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in numerous domains including deep learning, scientific computing, computer graphics, and simulation. The standard algorithm for multiplying two matrices has cubic time complexity O(n³), making it computationally intensive for large inputs. This project aims to implement and analyze a high-performance matrix multiplication algorithm that systematically exploits multiple levels of parallelism available in modern hardware architectures.

Modern computer systems provide several levels of parallelism that can be utilized to improve performance and reduce power consumption:
- Vector processing units for instruction-level parallelism (SIMD)
- Multiple cores for thread-level parallelism
- Specialized accelerators like GPUs for heterogeneous parallelism

By combining these approaches, we can achieve compounding performance benefits while gaining insights into the trade-offs between implementation complexity and performance gains.

### 2. Algorithm Description

#### 2.1 Baseline Algorithm

The standard matrix multiplication algorithm computes C = A × B for matrices A of size m×k and B of size k×n:

```
for i = 0 to m-1:
  for j = 0 to n-1:
    C[i,j] = 0
    for p = 0 to k-1:
      C[i,j] += A[i,p] * B[p,j]
```

This algorithm has poor cache locality due to strided memory access patterns, particularly for the B matrix. Our optimized implementation will address this and other inefficiencies through multiple parallelization strategies.

#### 2.2 Cache-Blocked Algorithm

To improve cache efficiency, we will implement a blocked algorithm that operates on submatrices:

```
for i = 0 to m-1 step BLOCK_SIZE:
  for j = 0 to n-1 step BLOCK_SIZE:
    for p = 0 to k-1 step BLOCK_SIZE:
      // Multiply blocks A[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE, p:p+BLOCK_SIZE] and 
      // B[p:p+BLOCK_SIZE, j:j+BLOCK_SIZE]
      // Add to block C[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE, j:j+BLOCK_SIZE]
```

Block sizes will be tuned to optimize for L1 and L2 cache sizes on target hardware.

### 3. Parallelization Strategies

#### 3.1 Instruction-Level Parallelism (SIMD)

We will implement SIMD optimizations using AVX-512 vector instructions to process multiple elements simultaneously:

- Utilize AVX-512 to process 8 floating-point operations in parallel
- Implement memory alignment to 64-byte boundaries for optimal vector operations
- Apply loop unrolling to reduce branch prediction overhead
- Use register blocking to maximize data reuse within vector registers

Example implementation for the inner block multiplication kernel:

```c
// Process 8 elements at once using AVX-512
void multiply_block_avx512(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, 
                          int block_size, int lda, int ldb, int ldc) {
  for (int i = 0; i < block_size; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < block_size; j += 8) {
      __m512 c_vec = _mm512_setzero_ps();
      
      for (int k = 0; k < block_size; k++) {
        __m512 a_vec = _mm512_set1_ps(A[i*lda + k]);
        __m512 b_vec = _mm512_loadu_ps(&B[k*ldb + j]);
        c_vec = _mm512_fmadd_ps(a_vec, b_vec, c_vec);
      }
      
      _mm512_storeu_ps(&C[i*ldc + j], c_vec);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Shared-Memory Parallelism (Multithreading)

We will leverage OpenMP to parallelize the outermost loop of our blocked algorithm:

- Implement OpenMP parallelization with dynamic scheduling
- Optimize thread affinity for NUMA architectures
- Explore recursive decomposition for better load balancing
- Apply thread-level blocking to optimize for shared cache usage

```c
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)
for (int i = 0; i < m; i += BLOCK_SIZE) {
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j += BLOCK_SIZE) {
    for (int p = 0; p < k; p += BLOCK_SIZE) {
      multiply_block_avx512(&A[i*lda + p], &B[p*ldb + j], 
                          &C[i*ldc + j], BLOCK_SIZE, lda, ldb, ldc);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3.3 Heterogeneous Parallelism (GPU)

For GPU acceleration, we will leverage NVIDIA's CUDA samples repository:

- Adapt and extend the `matrixMul` and related samples for our unified interface
- Analyze and understand the shared memory tiling techniques used in NVIDIA samples
- Implement performance measurement infrastructure to benchmark GPU implementations
- Explore tensor core acceleration using the `cudaTensorCoreGemm` sample (for newer GPUs)

The CUDA samples provide several implementations:
- Basic CUDA matrix multiplication with shared memory tiling
- cuBLAS-based implementation for reference comparison
- Tensor Core accelerated versions for mixed-precision calculations
